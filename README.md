# Gesture Controlled Presentation System 🎯🖐️

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Gesture Controlled Presentation System** is a computer vision–based project that allows users to control PowerPoint presentations using **hand gestures** captured through a laptop camera.

This project was built as my **first-ever engineering project** and is inspired by **Iron Man movies**, where Tony Stark controls virtual screens using hand gestures.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

The idea comes from **Iron Man (Marvel Cinematic Universe)**, where futuristic interfaces are controlled through natural hand movements. This project is a small real-world implementation of that concept using Python and computer vision.
